## Ch01: Getting to Know Typescript

- Item 2: start with `noImplicitAny` on
- Item 3: Code Generation is independent of Typescript types
  - `constructor(public width: number, public height: number)`
  - class introduces both a type and a value; interface only introduce a type
  - `as number` is a type operator, cannot affect runtime behavior
  - ways to query type at runtime: `Tagged unions`; `property checking`
  - `tagged unions`: `type Shape = Square | Rectangle;`
- Item 4: Structural Typing (duck typed)
  - have property beyond explicitly listed
  - facilitate unit testing
  - classes also follow structural typing rules; the same for `enum`
- Item 4: Limited user of the any type
  - `(as any)` is a type assertion
- Item 6: Editor and Language Services
  - autocomplete, inspection, navigation, and refactoring
- Item 7: Type as a set of values
  - this is the domain of the type
  - Itersection of types: 
    - `keyof (A&B) = (keyof A) | (keyof B)`
    - `keyof (A|B) = (keyof A) & (keyof B)`
  - `extends` as a constraint in a generic
    - `function sortBy<k extends keyof T, T>(vals: T[], key: K): T[] {...}`
  - `never`: empty set; `unknow`: universal set
  - `extends` means `assignable to`, `subtype of`, `subset of`
- Item 8: Type Space vs Value Space
  - many constructs have different means in two spaces (p.38)
- Item 9: prefer Type Declarations to Type Assertions
